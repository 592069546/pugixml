---

pugixml-1.10 is out. This is a maintenance release that fixes some compatibility issues and introduces several formatting features (read the [changelog](/docs/manual.html#v1.10) for details).

Highlights for this release include:

* XPath union operation now is ~2x faster to compute and results in a stable order that doesn't depend on pointer order
* Add `format_skip_control_chars` formatting flag to skip non-printable ASCII characters
* Add `format_attribute_single_quote` formatting flag to use single quotes for attribute values
* Add Visual Studio .natvis files to improve debugging experience

You can [download the source package](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/releases/download/v1.10/pugixml-1.10.zip) or get the new version from GitHub using the latest tag (https://github.com/zeux/pugixml).
