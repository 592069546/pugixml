title: pugixml 1.11 release
---

pugixml-1.11 is out. This is a maintenance release that fixes some compatibility issues and introduces several new APIs (read the [changelog](/docs/manual.html#v1.11) for details).

Highlights for this release include:

* Add xml_node::remove_attributes and xml_node::remove_children
* Add a way to customize floating point precision via xml_attribute::set and xml_text::set overloads
* XPath parser now limits recursion depth which prevents stack overflow on malicious queries

You can [download the source package](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/releases/download/v1.11/pugixml-1.11.zip) or get the new version from GitHub using the latest tag (https://github.com/zeux/pugixml).
